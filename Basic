PLATFORM INDEPENDENT
  Creating executable code in one os and then executing it in various independent os.
  Eg, We make a file firstDemo.java, then saving file in secondary memory.
      Compiler will fetch file from PM and send .java file to PM from SM and convert it into byte code in a file(.class).
      Jvm convert byte code to executable code; jvm load demo.class file from SM to PM: one jvm can understand one OS (so, it is paltform       independent.
  1. Source Code: Platform Independent
  2. Byte Code : Platform Independent
  3. Executable Code : Platform Dependent
  4. JVM : Platform Dependent
  5. Java Software : Platform Dependent
  6. Java Software Application : Platform Independent
