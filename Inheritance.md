# Inheritance
Subclass can access properties and methods of parent class.

## Super Class / Base Class
Existing xlass from which another class is derived.**Multiple Super Classes are not allowed.**

## Sub Class 
A class which is derived from another class.

Classes can be pervented from inheritance by using **final** keyword.
A sub class can access all **public** and **private** members.

### Benefits
* Reusability
* Super class is generic whereas subclass is more specialized
* Division of work among team
* Multilevel inheritance

<br><br>**extends** help in achieving Inheritance

## Type of Inheritance 
Single<br> 
Multilevel<br>
Heirarchial<br>
Multiple with interfaces<br>

## Final Class
* If a class is complete and does not require any subclass then that class can be prfixed with **final** keyword.
<br>* Class variables are made local variables by using constant keyword.
<br>* Any variable with final keyword, its value can never be changed.
<br>* Overriding of methods can be prevented by using final keyword.

## Super Keyword
* Distinguish between same variable name in super and sub class.
* Used in defining [constructor](https://github.com/Nehasingh1300/Java#java-constructor) of subclass.
